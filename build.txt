4. All dependencies are pre-installed in the virtual environment; no additional packages are required.
5. No extra environment variables or system configurations are necessary.

Running the Project:
--------------------
- To run the interpreter interactively, execute main.py from PyCharm or the command line:
  python main.py

- To run a script file as input, provide the filename as an argument:
  python main.py input.txt

- Output will appear in the PyCharm run console or terminal.

Input Handling:
---------------
- Interactive input through terminal prompt.
